4. **Make your changes**
   - Follow coding style guidelines.

   - Keep commits clean & meaningful.

5. **Tests**
   - Add new tests under `pipeline-generator/tests/` if applicable.

     ./pipeline-generator/tests/smoke_test.sh

6. **Push your branch**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-ci-workflow
    ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub, click **New Pull Request**.
   - Base branch = `main` of this repo.
   - Compare branch = your feature branch.
   - Fill out PR description with:
     - What you changed
     - Why this change is needed
     - Any related issues

---

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep PRs focused (1 feature/bugfix per PR).
- Make sure the branch is up to date with `main`.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style if possible:
  - `feat: add dynamic config support`
  - `fix: correct path in deploy script`
  - `docs: update contributing guide`

---

## Maintainer Workflow
- Review PRs for correctness, style, and tests.
- Merge with **Rebase & Merge** to keep history clean.
- Release process:
  - Open a release PR with:
    ```bash
    ./release.sh major | minor | patch | v*.*.*   # default: patch
    ```
  - After merging, tag the release:
    ```bash
    ./release.sh --tag
    ```
    Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag to `main` triggers GitHub Actions to publish the release automatically.

---

## Code style

- Shell scripts: use `set -euo pipefail`.
- Keep templates and Jenkinsfiles readable.
- Keep changes small and focusedâ€”one feature or bugfix per PR.

---

## Security

- Do not commit secrets or sensitive information.
- Use Jenkins credentials or environment variables for any secrets.
